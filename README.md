# Welcome to My Readline
Welcome to My Readline projeckt. 

Here I will try to explain basics of the program and how to make it work.

## Task
The task for the this assignment was to create a function that "my_readline" displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.

It basically needs to copy the Readline function. 

## Description
This project brought me back in the 1970s.

To be able to solve this problem I used a function to access, save and reorganize the data.

The function my_readline reads a line from the strean represented by fd and returns it into an allocated string.

## Installation
You can use "make" "make clean" and "make re" commands to install and activate the program.

Makefile has been flagged with -Wall -Wextra -Werror which is enough for this program.

You can use terminal to run the program "my_readline file READLINE_READ_SIZE"

## Usage
Basically after the "make" statement. Call the "./my_readline file READLINE_READ_SIZE" and you can give it the argument you wanted.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
./my_readline file READLINE_READ_SIZE
```
